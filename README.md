# Ensemble_project
 
The "Ensemble_project" is a GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing a project focused on Ensemble Techniques in machine learning. The project encompasses various ensemble methods, which involve combining multiple models to make accurate predictions. 

In addition to implementing ensemble techniques, the project also emphasizes the importance of data manipulation and dimensional reduction techniques. By carefully preprocessing the data and reducing its dimensionality, the project aims to enhance the overall accuracy of the models.

The impact of these data manipulation and dimensional reduction techniques is evident in the evaluation metric used, specifically the F1-score. Initially, the F1-score achieved a value of 87% without employing these techniques. However, through the application of data manipulation and dimensional reduction, the F1-score increased significantly to an impressive 94%.

The repository provides detailed documentation, code examples, and resources to facilitate understanding and implementation of ensemble techniques, data manipulation, and dimensional reduction methods. By exploring this repository, users can gain insights into how ensemble models can improve prediction accuracy and how to leverage data preprocessing techniques to optimize model performance.
